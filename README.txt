HISTORY
It started with a homemade Shadow Puppet Theater. A white sheet against one 
wall of an EZ-up shade structure, and a super-bright LED aimed at it. An array
of cardboard cutout silhouettes of various animals and character archetypes
lay on the floor, ready for action. People wandered in and played for a bit, 
and wandered off again after a while. In between these improvised "shows," 
there wasn't much to look at.
With Shadow Puppet Theater version 2, I introduced a "screen saver" type effect
by putting a fan inside the theater pointing at the screen and hanging various
air-powered movement toys inside (a slinky, a pinwheel, etc.). This made it 
fun to look at even when there was no one playing inside. However, a show tends
to move all of the movement toys out of the way, so I would have to go in and
"reset" the stage after every performance.
This project is an interactive digital art piece, with which players can 
interact when they care to, and which will take care of itself when they don't.

CONCEPT
A world to explore. Each of us is different, yet we explore a common world.
We share what we have learned with each other for mutual benefit.
There are no words or symbols that convey meaning in language in the game.
All meaning of the events on the screen is open to the user's own interpretation.

SETUP
The program display will be projected onto a large screen, mainly outdoors at 
night time. The neon-on-black aesthetic was chosen to complement this setting.

AUDIENCE
Many will observe, some will play. When the current player leaves, the game 
will revert to a self-play mode after a period of inactivity. Gameplay can 
transition easily back and forth between user-controlled and self-play mode.
