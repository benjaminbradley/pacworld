NEXT STEPS:

- IMMEDIATE NEXT TODO: convert map square types to classes (path, field, room). so that they can be modified (e.g. adding another door)
- FIX: adjacent door placement rules attempts to place doors on room sides that already have doors. - find TODONEXT in world.py
- in Shape.update(), calculate current angle over the past 5 frames, not just the last 1 frame (need to expand startMapCenter to include more history)
- art pieces
- get a swirl from an art piece
- swirling shapes inside
- activate a swirl
- other characters
- get a swirl from another character
- give a swirl to another character
- idle behavior for current character (plays itself)
- switch between characters (for idle)
- different art pieces
