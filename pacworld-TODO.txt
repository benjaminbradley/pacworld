NEXT STEPS:

- recombine animated sprite code from earlier POC
- procedurally generated map based on a random seed
- art pieces
- get a swirl from an art piece
- swirling shapes inside
- activate a swirl
- other characters
- get a swirl from another character
- give a swirl to another character
- idle behavior for current character (plays itself)
- switch between characters (for idle)
- different art pieces


DONE:
- break testworldmap.py into classes & main code
- ...everything else leading up to this...
- world map with 

- animated sprites
- sound
- graphics
