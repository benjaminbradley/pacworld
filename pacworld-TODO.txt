NEXT STEPS for MVP:
- make a couple of interesting looking art pieces (not just a circle)
- get a swirl from an art piece
- swirling shapes inside the characters
- activate a swirl
- other characters
- get a swirl from another character
- give a swirl to another character
- idle behavior for current character (plays itself)
- switch between characters (for idle)

BUG FIXES:
- player occasionally gets stuck in a wall (collision detection not preventing movement?)

ENHANCEMENTS:
- in Shape.update(), calculate current angle over the past 5 frames, not just the last 1 frame (need to expand startMapCenter to include more history)
- allow multiple doors per room side
- more different art pieces

LOWER LEVEL BUG FIXES:
- art drifts during player movement (laggy drawing?)
