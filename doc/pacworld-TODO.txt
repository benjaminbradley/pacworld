CURRENT TASK: get a swirl from an art piece
TODO:
- get transfer animation to move outside of art image rect (maybe apply to map instead of art? - add draw check to see if it's onscreen)
- structure to store swirls for each character
- add a new swirl to the char from touching the art

NEXT STEPS for MVP:
- swirling shapes inside the characters - draw them
- activate a swirl
- add new types of swirls
- move between swirls left/right
- other characters
- get a swirl from another character "ask"
- give a swirl to another character "give"
- idle behavior for current character (plays itself)
- switch between characters (for idle)


ENHANCEMENTS:
- in Shape.update(), calculate current angle over the past 5 frames, not just the last 1 frame (need to expand startMapCenter to include more history)
- allow multiple doors per room side
- make more interesting different looking art pieces

LOWER LEVEL BUG FIXES:
- art drifts during player movement (laggy drawing?)
