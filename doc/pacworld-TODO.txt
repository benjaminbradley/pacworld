- why is self.type == TRANSFER_EFFECT code in swirl.py#draw() ?

---------------------------------------------------- FUTURE TASKS:

BUGFIX:
- occasionally it hangs during world creation. at least once it was during room population. add something to detect repeating cycles and add a break-threshhold.
- FIXMEs

NEXT STEPS for MVP:
- add new types of swirls
- only one type of each swirl
- max # of swirls
- other characters
- get a swirl from another character "ask"
- give a swirl to another character "give"
- idle behavior for current character (plays itself)
- switch between characters (for idle)
- when the world reaches a certain level of swirl "saturation" (e.g. % of characters have # of swirls) then remake the world

PERFORMANCE:
- turn drawn swirls into sprites to speed animation
- change all shape.makeSprite calls to set a dirty flag, collapse into a single makeSprite call

ENHANCEMENTS:
- allow multiple doors per room side
- make more interesting different looking art pieces

LOWER LEVEL BUG FIXES:
- art drifts during player movement (laggy drawing?)
