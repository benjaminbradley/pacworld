---------------------------------------------------- FUTURE TASKS:

BUGFIX:
- some shapes get stuck in routing? e.g. seed 7834
- FIXMEs

NEXT STEPS for MVP:
- add new types of swirls (change size, sides, color, etc - what attributes are fixed, but variable?)
- add effects when activating a swirl
- add collision detection for size/side changes
- only one type of each swirl
- max # of swirls
- get a swirl from another character "ask"
- idle behavior for current character (plays itself)
- switch between characters (for idle)
- when the world reaches a certain level of swirl "saturation" (e.g. % of characters have # of swirls) then remake the world
- other TODOs in code

PERFORMANCE:
- turn drawn swirls into sprites to speed animation
- change all shape.makeSprite calls to set a dirty flag, collapse into a single makeSprite call :: watch out to preserve in shape.update(): self.changeAngle() followed by self.move() in the same update, and collision test will matter /// maybe a flag that signals mask-only generation or full graphical mode


ENHANCEMENTS:
- allow multiple doors per room side
- make more interesting different looking art pieces
- special ability to activate all of your swirls one after another
