CURRENT TASK: get a swirl from an art piece
TODO:
- get transfer animation to move outside of art image rect (maybe apply to map instead of art? - add draw check to see if it's onscreen)

BUGFIX:
- occasionally it hangs during world creation. at least once it was during room population. add something to detect repeating cycles and add a break-threshhold.

NEXT STEPS for MVP:
- turn drawn swirls into sprites to speed animation
- add new types of swirls
- only one type of each swirl
- max # of swirls
- move between swirls left/right
- other characters
- get a swirl from another character "ask"
- give a swirl to another character "give"
- idle behavior for current character (plays itself)
- switch between characters (for idle)
- when the world reaches a certain level of swirl "saturation" (e.g. % of characters have # of swirls) then remake the world

ENHANCEMENTS:
- in Shape.update(), calculate current angle over the past 5 frames, not just the last 1 frame (need to expand startMapCenter to include more history)
- allow multiple doors per room side
- make more interesting different looking art pieces

LOWER LEVEL BUG FIXES:
- art drifts during player movement (laggy drawing?)
