TODONOW: break up current changes into separate commits:
- art_onscreen and related stuff ?
- changing maptopleft references to map.getcenter
- movement activity
  including diagonals
- stop to think activity







- why is self.type == TRANSFER_EFFECT code in swirl.py#draw() ?

CURRENT FEATURE: make other characters move around

SUBTASK: determine "destination selection" algorithm
if something interesting is onscreen, and we haven't seen it yet, and we can get to it, then go to that thing
else - go to an open spot within view and look around again

TODO:
REFACTOR: all shape movement should be based on the sprite's center, not on it's topleft
	may need to rewrite all uses of shape.mapTopLeft
FIX windowrect for checking onscreen-art in auto shape should be based on that shape's windowrect, not players
- fixed, but at the price that pathfinding is wrong?
FIX NPC movement is really jerky - maybe wobbling because the linearspeed is too high, bouncing over the target?
SLOW DOWN MOVEMENT!!!
add look around behavior
add random pauses for contemplation
re-enable autonomous behavior by default	

---------------------------------------------------- FUTURE TASKS:

BUGFIX:
- occasionally it hangs during world creation. at least once it was during room population. add something to detect repeating cycles and add a break-threshhold.
- FIXMEs

NEXT STEPS for MVP:
- add new types of swirls (change size, sides, color, etc - what attributes are fixed, but variable?)
- add collision detection for size/side changes
- only one type of each swirl
- max # of swirls
- get a swirl from another character "ask"
- idle behavior for current character (plays itself)
- switch between characters (for idle)
- when the world reaches a certain level of swirl "saturation" (e.g. % of characters have # of swirls) then remake the world
- other TODOs in code

PERFORMANCE:
- turn drawn swirls into sprites to speed animation
- change all shape.makeSprite calls to set a dirty flag, collapse into a single makeSprite call :: watch out to preserve in shape.update(): self.changeAngle() followed by self.move() in the same update, and collision test will matter /// maybe a flag that signals mask-only generation or full graphical mode


ENHANCEMENTS:
- allow multiple doors per room side
- make more interesting different looking art pieces
- special ability to activate all of your swirls one after another

LOWER LEVEL BUG FIXES:
- sprites (art & shapes) drifts during player movement (laggy drawing?)
