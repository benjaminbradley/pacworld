digital interactive art piece
working name: pacworld


features:
- idle behavior
- visitors can interact with the art


entities:
- characters
- environmental features


main screen:
- black background
- one or more characters appear on screen, represented as line drawing shapes.
- characters travel around the screen and interact with their environment and each other.
- environmental features may restrict or cause character movement


character
- has a shape and color
- has one or more shapes inside it, in constant motion
- has a defining feature to indicate "forward" direction
- has a "do something" 

environmental feature: wall
- looks like: a line, straight or curved
- effect: blocks the character's movement.

environmental feature: slide
- looks like: conveyor belt w/ arrows
- effect: moves the character rapidly to a new destination

environmental feature: art piece
- looks like: (varies, see examples below)
- effect: (nothing, or varies)



shapes
- type : circle, line, triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, etc...


example art: a fractal tree which grows and withers

example art: a spiral which rotates

example art: an animated mandala



example character: classic pacman
- shape: circle
- color: yellow
- forward: "wedge"
- interior: solid circle



input controls:
- move character (f/b, l/r)
- input : "ask" (characters) or "observe" (art)		sound: going-up inflection like a question
- output : "give" (characters) or "use" (art)		sound: going-down like a sigh
- activate/toggle? : activate current "quality"
- next : move to next "quality"




procedurally generated map:
	map components
	- fields (rectangular open space - medium to large)
	- rooms (a rectangular enclosed space with 1 or 2 doors - small to medium)
	- pathway (a long rectangle - medium-to-large by small)
	- rocks (an enclosed rectangle - small)
	
	input constants:
	- 'd' (1d) - starting diameter of character
	- map size : h x w (in 'd' units)
	- cell size = (calculated) map size divided by 'd'
	
	procedure:
	1. generate pathways
		minimum length o/2 (where o is the longest of h or w)
		maximum length s (where s is the shortest of h or w)
		random direction:
			a maximum of 2 (or 3 with a separation clause?) pathways may be parallel to s
			the others must be parallel to o
		ok for large pathways to intersect in the middle, medium pathways should only touch at corners at their ends
		goal is to have between 2s+o and s+2o total length of pathways
		
	
	2. generate fields
		if two or more pathways could be connected with a field, do it
		
	
	3. populate rooms around fields and pathways
		- each door must lead to either a field, a pathway, or another room

	4. place rocks
		- 4 or 5 randomly around the map? maybe skip this step? or it's used to identify inaccessible enclosed spaces?
	
	picking a size:
	inputs: size ranges
		- gather all weighted values within size ranges
		- pick a random value based on all of the weights

	"small" size, sidelength distribution:
	20% 1d
	50% 2d
	30% 3d
	
	"medium" size sidelength distribution:
	4d	50%
	5d	50%
	
	"large" size sidelength distribution:
	6d	30%
	7d	40% 
	8d	30%
